        <h4> The two primary sections of an HTML document are:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                HEAD
                <ul type="square">
                    <li>The <b><i>Title</i></b> tag in HEAD section gives the title to the Page.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                BODY
                <ul type="square">
                    <li> Whatever is written in the BODY tag appears on the browser window.</li>
                    <li>Unordered lists can be created using the <b><i>ul</i></b> tag followed by li tags that list out
                        the bulleted
                        text. <b><i>Li</i></b> tag can have the attribute, <b><i>type</i></b> = <b><i>circle</i></b> or
                        <b><i>disc</i></b> or <b><i>square</i></b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Ordered lists are created using the ol tag followed by li tags that can have the attribute
                        <b><i>type
                                = 1</i></b> or <b><i>a</i></b> or <b><i>A</i></b> or <b><i>I</i></b>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <hr><b></b>
    </hr>

    <div>
        <p>
            In addition to lists, the text can be “physically formatted” to appear
            either <b>bold</b> or <i>italicized</i> or <u>underlined</u> or <strike>strike through</strike> or it could
            also be
            <sub>subscripted</sub> or <sup>superscripted</sup>
            depending
            upon the need of the creator.
        </p>
        <p>
            The text can be made to appear more attractive using fonts of various styles. The <b><i>font</i></b>
            tag does this job. The <b>face</b> attribute can change the font style to whichever it is equated to. The
            <b><i></i>size</i></b>
            attribute will
            change the font size which can range from 1 to 7. <font color="red">color attribute will obviously change
                font color if
                equated to
                various combinations of RGB values.</font>
        </p>
        <p>
            This apart if the background color has of the document has to be varied then,
            the <b>bgColor</b> attribute of the <b>body</b> tag can be set or the entire text can be aligned using the
            <b><i>align</i></b>
            attribute.
            Indentation with the help of the “paragraph tags” or a new line character with a line break can be achieved.
            Some
            special characters like copyright i.e. &copy; or registered trademark i.e. &reg; that are not the part of a
            standard
            keyboard
            can be inserted using the HTML character set. Apart from it, if the < &amp;> signs are to displayed on the
                browser then
                corresponding character set equivalent has to be chosen. Text alignment can be either left / center /
                right; this can
                be done using the <b><i>div</i></b> container tag that has the <b><i>align</i></b> attribute. You can
                set the alignment accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The power of
            net lies in its capacity to link various web pages scattered over different places on the net. The web pages
            can be
            anchored to each other using the <b><i>a href tags</i></b>. For instance &lt <A HREF=<font
                color="blue">http://www.anuda.com/index.html</font></A>> Click here will link
            to the website referenced by HREF. The user interface becomes better looking if images are included
            using the <b>
                <i>img</i></b> tag. Its attributes
            <b><i>src, height, width, align, border</i></b> etc will
            produce
            corresponding effects.
            Images can
            be made clickable if the <b><i>img</i></b> tag is contained within the anchor tags as demonstrated.
        </p>

        <p><b>
                An image is to be inserted
                exactly at the bottom at the center position, should be square in shape with a border & should display a
                text when
                the mouse moves over it. Another clickable image that will lead to a different HTML page should also be
                inserted at
                the topmost portion of the web page, it should be wide enough to fit almost 75% of the page’s center.
